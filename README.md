# My **Smartwatch**
My mother has bought me a smartwatch to my birthday (2023); so I've own a
[Xiaomi Watch 2 Pro](https://www.mi.com/de/product/xiaomi-watch-2-pro/) (see also
my [**hardware 'tree'**](https://kekse.biz/?~hardware)).

## Watch Faces
Since I wanted a special watch face design, I decided to create my own one(s).

So I came up to [**facer.io**](https://facer.io/). There you can design such for free (even if
not everything is for free there). Now I've designed seven watch faces (**2024-04-07**) which
I'm presenting also on my [private website](https://kekse.biz/?~watch) and my
[Facer 'kekse' profile](https://www.facer.io/u/kekse). And NOW also here..

### My "**Cake Collection**"
I made them 'from scratch', as usual. Some are better, some are merely tryouts.. here they are,
with the original, animated `.webp` images (plus some transparency added in there).
