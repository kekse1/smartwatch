# My **Smartwatch**
My mother has bought me a smartwatch to my birthday (2023); so I own a [Xiaomi Watch 2 Pro](https://kekse.biz/?~hardware).

## Watch Faces
Because I wanted a special watch face design (I really love 24h analog),
I decided to create my own one(s).

So I came up to [**facer.io**](https://facer.io/). There you can design as many as you want
absolutely for free (even if not everything is for free there).

I'm also presenting them on my [private website](https://kekse.biz/?~smartwatch),
and on my [Facer **kekse** profile](https://www.facer.io/u/kekse).

### My ["**Cake Design**" Collection](https://www.facer.io/collection/cake-collection-8e8db4066b)
I made them 'from scratch', as usual. Some are better, some are merely tryouts..
here they are, with the original, animated `.webp` images (plus some transparency).

- [x] Compass angle string and direction name
- [x] Weekday (left) also shows progress from monday to sunday(!)
