My mother has bought me a smartwatch to my birthday [2023], so
I own a [Xiaomi Watch 2 Pro](https://kekse.biz/?~hardware) now.

## My ["**Biscuits**" Collection](https://www.facer.io/collection/cake-collection-8e8db4066b)
Because I wanted a special watch face design (I really love 24h analog),
I decided to create my own one(s).

So I came up to [**facer.io**](https://facer.io/). There you can design as many as you want
absolutely for free (even if not everything is for free there).

I'm also presenting them on my [private website](https://kekse.biz/?~smartwatch),
and on my [Facer **kekse** profile](https://www.facer.io/u/kekse). .. AND here:
### [**`biscuits.casa`**](https://biscuits.casa/)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.facer.io/collection/cake-collection-8e8db4066b">
    <img src="images/biscuits.jpg" alt="Biscuits [Collection]" /></a>

I made them all 'from scratch', as usual. Some are better, some are merely tryouts..
and here they are, with the original, animated `.webp` images (plus some transparency).

The **Inspector** is available for any of these.. there you'll my 'source codes' (maybe
interesting for you, because there is sometimes 'many' maths hidden in there; inter alia
all the rules of three, or even the sine and cosine positionings, etc.)! **;)~**

- [x] The digital time rotates around in the position of the analog clock (it's hour, in 24h design)
- [x] The digital date rotates around the position of the month's progress
- [x] This date shows both the name and the number of the month
- [x] The digital weekday rotates around the position of the weekday progress of the week
- [x] The big green arrow on the outside indicates the current year's progress

- [x] One progress around the clock is the compass
- [x] The other progress around is the watch battery level
